# SEASONAL CHANGES IN PARCEL B

This website represents a summary and documentation for my research project documenting seasonal changes in Parcel B, the forest adjoining Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts. I used a combination of several cameras to document changes as I observed them on regular walks through the forest, and took notes regarding the changes I observed. I researched the changes and built a [bibliography](#) of research relevant to the changing phenomena I observed. Here, find the images I captured, each with a summary explanation of the relevant literature review findings.
